        <h2>2-Physical Characteristics:</h2>
        <p><b>Cats </b>come in a wide variety of breeds, each with its own unique characteristics. <br>They range in size from small breeds like the Singapura to larger breeds like the Maine Coon. <br>Cats are known for their retractable claws, sharp senses <i>(especially keen night vision)</i>, <br>and a flexible body that allows them to land on their feet after a fall, a behavior known as the "righting reflex."</p>
